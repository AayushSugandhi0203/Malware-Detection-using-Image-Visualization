# Malware-Detection-using-Image-Visualization

To evade detection, malware authors introduce polymorphism to the malicious components. This means that malicious files belonging to the same malware "family", with the same forms of malicious behavior, are constantly modified and/or obfuscated using various tactics, such that they look like many different files.

## Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from this [Link](https://sarvamblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/supervised-classification-with-k-fold.html)

## Feature Exraction

Extracted the Features from the Image using **LBPH(Local Binary Pattern Histogram)** Techniques

## Models

Developed Various Machine Learning Models using

* K nearest Neighbours
* Naive Bayes
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Stacking Model comprieses of SVM, Random Forest and Naive Bayes.

Also develped a 2D CNN Model using *Split Folders* and *Image DataGenerator Class*.
